# Overview ðŸ‘€ 
 
## Framework for building Parachains ðŸŽ¨

This is an alternative solution for building Polkadot/Substrate-compatible runtimes in _Go_.
It aims to streamline the process of building a parachain with emphasis on simplicity and ease of use over configurability and feature richness. 
It is designed to be straightforward to understand and use, while still providing the necessary tools to build a parachain.

## Why choose an alternative implementation in _Go_ ðŸŒ±

While there are several implementations of Polkadot Hosts in [Rust](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate), 
[C++](https://github.com/soramitsu/kagome), and [Go](https://github.com/ChainSafe/gossamer), the only option for writing
Polkadot Runtimes is in [Rust](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate). Writing Polkadot Runtimes in _Go_ is exciting,
mainly because of _Go_'s simplicity and automatic memory management. It is a modern, powerful, and fast language, backed
by Google and used in many of their software, thus making it an ideal candidate for implementing Polkadot Runtimes.


## How it started ðŸ’¡

This project is a result of [previous research](https://github.com/LimeChain/gosemble-research), funded by [Web3 Foundation](https://web3.foundation) **Grants**, and developed and maintained by [LimeChain](https://limechain.tech). The research provides conclusions if _Go_ is a suitable choice for writing Polkadot Runtimes and further aids the development of a _Go_ [**toolchain**](./overview/toolchain), capable of producing compatible runtimes.

If you are new to Polkadot, please check our [**onboarding guide**](./development/onboarding) on how to get started with the project.
