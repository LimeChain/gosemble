**Go implementation of Polkadot/Substrate compatible runtimes**

The following project is based on previous [**research**](https://github.com/LimeChain/gosemble-research) funded by [**Web3 Foundation**](https://web3.foundation) **Grants** and developed, and maintained by [**LimeChain**](https://limechain.tech), which provides conclusions if Go is a suitable choice for writing Polkadot Runtimes and further aids the development of a Go toolchain capable of producing compatible runtimes.

While there are several implementations of Polkadot Hosts in [Rust](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate), [C++](https://github.com/soramitsu/kagome), and [Go](https://github.com/ChainSafe/gossamer), there is no other option than [Rust](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate) for writing Polkadot Runtimes. And writing Polkadot Runtimes in Go is exciting, mainly because of Go's simplicity and automatic memory management. 
It is a modern, powerful, and fast language, backed by Google and used in many of their software, thus making it an ideal candidate for implementing Polkadot Runtimes.
