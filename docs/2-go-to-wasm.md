# Research Feasibility of a Go Runtime - Oct 2022

## Abstract

The idea of writing Polkadot Runtimes in Go is exciting, mainly because of Go's simplicity and automatic memory management. However Polkadot's design decisions around memory management could potentialy make Go's main selling points pointless. Although the language specification doesn't mention how it should manage its memory, the Go community recognizes it as a language with GC, and anything else would be more like a different language with a similar syntax. So aren't we setting up ourselves for failure with Go right from the beginning?

Questions we are gonna try to answer:
* What are the design decisions behind Substrate's architecture - Webassembly specification, Host/Runtime interaction, Runtime memory management?
* On top of which Webassembly features is Substrate built on? Current limitations and proposals that might help in the future?
* Which compiler toolchain is best suited for producing Wasm with GC managed runtime - LLVM or Binaryen?
* How Go and TinyGo internals work and differ from each other - compiler, runtime, GC?
* What are the challenges of implementing a Substrate Runtime with GC managed language like Go?
* What are the steps required to implement PoC toolchain and future improvements?


## Substrate design decisions

**WebAssembly MVP specification**

The Runtime Wasm module targets [WebAssembly MVP](https://github.com/WebAssembly/design/blob/main/MVP.md) without any extensions enabled.
Module's domain-specific API consists of:
* exported API functions, the business logic (`Core_version`, `Core_execute_block`, `Core_initialize_block`, etc).
* imported Host provided functions (`ext_allocator_malloc_version_1`, `ext_allocator_free_version_1`, etc).
* imported Host provided memory.
* exported linker specific globals (`__heap_base`, `__data_end`).
* exported `__indirect_function_table` (WIP and not enabled currently).

**WASI interface**

Polkadot is a non-browser environment, but it is not an OS. It doesn't seeks to provide a system-level API comparable to an OS like files, networking, or any other major part of the things provided by WASI.

**SCALE codec**

Runtime data, coming in the form of byte code, needs to be as light as possible. The SCALE codec provides the capability of efficiently encoding and decoding it, since being built for LE architectures, which is compatible with Wasm environments.

**Runtime calls**

Each function call into the Runtime is done with fresh allocated memory (via the shared allocator), either for sharing input data or results. Arguments are SCALE encoded into a byte array and copied into that section of the Wasm shared memory. Allocations do not persist between calls. The Runtime uses the same Host provided allocator for all heap allocations, so the Host is in charge of the Wasm heap memory management.
Data passing the Runtime API is always SCALE encoded, Host API call on the other hand try to avoid all encoding.

**Exported globals**

The Runtime is expected to export `__heap_base` global indicating the beginning of the heap. It is used by the Host allocator to prevent memory allocations below that address and avoid clashes with the stack and data sections.

**Imported or exported memory**

Imported memory works a little bit better than exported memory since it avoids some edge cases, although it also has some downsides, but it does not matter too much. Working with exported memory is almost certainly still supported. In fact, this is how it worked in the beginning. However the current spec describes that memory should be made available to the Polkadot Runtime for import under the symbol name `memory`.

**External memory management**

The design in which allocation functions are on the Host side is dictated by the fact that some of the Host functions might return buffers of data of unknown size. That means that the Wasm code cannot efficiently provide buffers upfront. For example, let's examine the Host function that returns a given storage value. The storage value's size is not known upfront in the general case, so the Wasm caller cannot pre-allocate the buffer upfront. A potential solution is to first call the Host function without a buffer, which will return the value's size, and then do the second call passing a buffer of the required size. For some Host functions, caches could be put in place for mitigation, some other functions cannot be implemented in the such model at all. To solve this problem, it was chosen to place the allocator on the Host side.

Note, however, that this is not the only possible solution. For instance, there is an ongoing discussion about moving the allocator into the Wasm: [1](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/issues/11883)

Notably, the allocator maintains some of its data structures inside the linear memory and some other structures outside.

**Support of concurrency**

The Runtime executes in serial, the parallelism is accomplished through a network of parallel running chains (Parachains). It is primarily because creating a semantic for deterministic parallel executing is really difficult in general.


## WebAssembly MVP features, limitations and future proposals

**Features**
* instruction format for bytecode stack machine
* fast execution
* compact
* portable
* Little-endian byte order when translating between values and bytes.
* Linear memory, a contiguous, byte-addressable, linear address space, spanning from offset 0 and extending up to a varying memory size. Can be resized, but only grown (`grow_memory`, `memory.grow`).
* Single specially-designated default linear memory which is the linear memory accessed by all the memory operators.
* Linear memory cannot be shared between threads of execution. 

**Limitations**

Linear memories (default or otherwise) can either be imported or defined inside the module. After import or definition, there is no difference when accessing a linear memory whether it was imported or defined internally.
In the MVP, linear memory cannot be shared between threads of execution. The addition of threads will allow this.

**Proposals**
* Allow setting protection and creating mappings within the contiguous linear memory.
* In the MVP, there are only default linear memories but new memory operators may be added after the MVP which can also access non-default memories.
* WebAssembly/gc proposal most likely won't help [1](https://github.com/WebAssembly/gc/issues/59).
* there is no WebAssembly specification for exports and runtime behavior around allocation.

To support an automatic memory management, the [GC proposal](https://github.com/WebAssembly/gc/blob/main/proposals/gc/Overview.md) might be handy. But the Wasm runtime supports only WebAssembly MVP currently, also the GC proposal is under development and it is not yet clear if Polkadot will be able to leverage the GC proposal. Potential problems include determinism (is there anything in GC that causes ND? Can it be tamed efficiently?) and safety (Is it possible for a host to limit the resource consumption reliably and deterministically?).


## LLVM vs Binaryen compiler backends

* LLVM is much more powerful as an optimizer.
* LLVM does not support Wasm GC, and the future there is unclear. In general, GC is not a main focus for LLVM (almost all the languages using it use linear memory, C, C++, Rust, Swift, Zig, etc.).
* LLVM supports wasm object files, DWARF, and other things which are very useful in the non-GC world (they may also help in GC in the future, that's unclear; we'll add support to Binaryen as needed).

* Binaryen compiles much more quickly.
* Binaryen is much smaller.
* Binaryen is a good choice for languages with GC and intend to compile to Wasm GC. And we will be able to compile Wasm GC to Wasm MVP, as a polyfill until Wasm GC is everywhere, but not the opposite.


## Go

### Compiler

The default compiler is `gc`. There are also `gccgo` which uses the GCC back-end and `gollvm` which uses the LLVM infrastructure (somewhat less mature).

```
// Frontend Compiler (lexing, parsing, typechecking)

CODE -> tokenizer/lexer/scanner (lexical analysis) -> TOKENS STREAM
TOKENS STREAM -> go/parser (syntactic analysis) -> AST (annotated)
AST -> go/types (type check) -> AST (with types)
AST (with types) -> golang.org/x/tools/go/ssa (convert) -> SSA

// Optimization

* variable capturing, inlining, escape analysis, closure rewriting, walk

SSA (higher level with Go-specific constructs like interfaces and goroutines) -> convert (tinygo) -> LLVM IR
LLVM IR -> optimize (llvm) -> LLVM IR (optimize by a mixture of handpicked LLVM optimization passes, TinyGo-specific optimizations ()

// Backend Compiler

LLVM IR (optimized) -> convert (llvm) -> MACHINE CODE
MACHINE CODE -> convert (llvm) -> OBJECT FILE
OBJECT FILE -> link (llvm) -> EXECUTABLE
```

### Runtime

Implements GC, scheduler included in every Go program. Contains a lot of type information at runtime.

**Memory Management**

Process
* does not have direct access to the physical memory
* virtual memory abstracts the access to the physical memory (via segmentation and page tables)

Process Memory Layout
```

Stack
* managed by the compiler
* elastic
* one stack per goroutine

Heap
* allocated by the memory allocator and collected by the garbage collector
* it is not an entity and there is no linear containment of memory that defines the Heap
* any memory reserved for application use in the process space is available for heap memory allocation

Go uses escape analysis and Garbage Collector. Allocator is tightly coupled with the Garbage Collector.
```

      |
 _____▼____
|          | 
|   Heap   | ◄------ Collector
|__________|
```

Allocator
* allocate new blocks with the correct size
* deals with fragmentation (merge smaller block to allow allocation of larger ones)

Garbage Collector
* tracking memory allocations in heap memory
* releasing allocations that are no longer needed
* keeping allocatiosn that are still in use

* tracing garbage collector (not reference counting)
* hybrid stop-the-world/concurrent collector (stop-the-world part limited by a 10ms deadline)
* CPU cores dedicated to running the concurrent collector
* tri-color mark-and-sweep algorithm

* non-generational
* non-compacting
* fully precise
* incurs a small cost if the program is moving pointers around
* lower latency, but most likely also lower throughput

*Collection*
1. Mark Setup (stop the world)
  * turn on write barrier
  * stop all goroutines

2. Marking (concurrent)
  * inspect the stack to find root pointers to the heap
  * traverse the heap graph from those root pointers
  * mark values on the heap that are still in use
  * slow down allocations to speed up collection

3. Mark Termination (stop the world)
  * turn the write barrier off
  * various cleaup tasks
  * next collection goal is acalulated

*Sweeping*
Freeing Heap Memory
* occurs when the goroutines attempt to allocate new heap memory
* the latency of sweeping is added to the cost of performing new allocation

Compiler decides (via escape analysis) when a value should be allocated on the Heap
* sharing down (passign pointers) typically stays on the Stack
* sharing up (returning pointers) typically escapes on the Heap

* when the value could be referenced after the function that constructed it returns
* if the value is too large to fit on the stack
* when the compiler doesn't know the size of the value at compile time

**Concurrency**

The scheduler runs goroutines, pauses and resumes them on blocking channel ops. or mutex ops, coordinates blocking system calls, io, runtime GC. Goroutines are use space threads managed by the runtime.

**Parallelism**


## TinyGo

It is a subset of Go with very different goals from the standard Go. It is a new compiler and runtime aimed to support many different small embedded devices with a single processor core that require certain optimizations mostly toward size.

*Goals*
* Have very small binary sizes.
* Support for most common microcontroller boards.
* Be usable on the web using WebAssembly.
* Good CGo support, with no more overhead than a regular function call.
* Support most standard library packages and compile most Go code without modification.

*Non-goals*
* Using more than one core.
* Be efficient while using zillions of goroutines. However, good goroutine support is certainly a goal.
* Be as fast as `gc`. However, LLVM will probably be better at optimizing certain things so TinyGo might actually turn out to be faster for number crunching.
* Be able to compile every Go program out there.

### Compiler

The compiler uses (mostly) the standard library to parse Go programs and LLVM to optimize the code and generate machine code for the target architecture.

**Pipeline (Lowering)**
```
// Frontend Compiler (lexing, parsing, typechecking)

CODE -> parse (go/parser) -> AST
AST -> type check (go/types) -> AST (with types)
AST (with types) -> convert (golang.org/x/tools/go/ssa) -> SSA

// Optimization

SSA (higher level with Go-specific constructs like interfaces and goroutines) -> convert (tinygo) -> LLVM IR
LLVM IR -> optimize (llvm) -> LLVM IR (optimize by a mixture of handpicked LLVM optimization passes, TinyGo-specific optimizations (escape analysis, string-to-[]byte optimizations, etc.) and custom lowering.)

// Backend Compiler

LLVM IR (optimized) -> convert (llvm) -> MACHINE CODE
MACHINE CODE -> convert (llvm) -> OBJECT FILE
OBJECT FILE -> link (llvm) -> EXECUTABLE
```

* root: contains the command line interface for the tinygo command and all its subcommands
* builder: orchestrates the build
* loader: loads and typechecks the code, and produces an AST
* compiler: the compiler itself, makes little attempt at optimizing code
* interp: tries to run package initializers at compile time as far as possible
* transform: implements various optimizations necessary to produce working and efficient code

### Runtime

The runtime is written from scratch, optimized for size instead of speed and re-implements some compiler intrinsics and packages:

* Startup code (device specific runtime initialization of memory, timers)
* GC (copied from micropython, super simple, optimized for size, runs the GC once it runs out of memory)
* Memory Allocator
* Goroutines scheduler
* Channels
* Time handling (every chip has a clock)
* Hashmap implementation (optimized for size instead of speed)
* Runtime functions like maps, slice append, defer, ... (various things that are not implemented in the compiler)
* Operations on strings
* `sync` & `reflect` package (strongly connected to the runtime)

**Basic features**

All basic types, slices, all regular control flow including switch, closures and bound methods are supported, `defer` keyword is almost entirely supported, with the exception of deferring some builtin functions, interfaces are quite stable and should work well in almost all cases. Type switches and type asserts are also supported, as well as calling methods on interfaces. The only exception is comparing two interface values.
Maps are usable but not complete. You can use any type as a value, but only some types are acceptable as map keys (strings, integers, pointers, and structs/arrays that contain only these types). Also, they have not been optimized for performance and will cause linear lookup times in some cases.

**Memory Management**

 there's no concurrent GC that would free it meanwhile.

Heap with a garbage collector. While not directly a language feature, garbage collection is important for most Go programs to make sure their memory usage stays in reasonable bounds.

Garbage collection is currently supported on all platforms, although it works best on 32-bit chips. A simple conservative mark-sweep collector is used that will trigger a collection cycle when the heap runs out (that is fixed at compile time) or when requested manually using `runtime.GC()`. Some other collector designs are used for other targets, TinyGo will automatically pick a good GC for a given target.

Careful design may avoid memory allocations in main loops. You may want to compile with `-print-allocs=.` to find out where allocations happen and why they happen.

**Concurrency**

Goroutines and channels work for the most part, for platforms such as WebAssembly the support is a bit more limited (calling a blocking function may for example allocate heap memory).

**Parallelism**

Single core only.


## Technical challenges

**Toolchain support for Wasm for non-browser environments**
* The official Go compiler does not support Wasm for non-browser environments [1](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/31105), [2](https://substrate.stackexchange.com/questions/60/what-is-gossamer-and-how-does-it-compare-to-substrate/89#89), only Wasm with browser specific API. An alternative options is to use TinyGo.

**Wasm features that are not part of the MVP**
* TinyGo makes use of some features which are not supported in the targeted Wasm MVP, such as bulk memory operations (`memory.copy`, `memory.fill` used to reduce the code size) and other extensions.

**Standard library support**
* The standard library relies on the `reflect` package (most common types like numbers, strings, and structs are supported), which is not fully supported by TinyGo [1](https://github.com/tinygo-org/tinygo/pull/2640). The core primitives and SCALE serialization logic that we intended to reuse from [gossamer](https://github.com/ChainSafe/gossamer) all rely on the `reflect` package.
* Many features of Cgo are still unsupported (#cgo statements are only partially supported).

**External memory allocator and GC**
* According to the Polkadot specification, the Wasm module does not include a memory allocator, it imports memory from the Host and relies on Host imported functions for all heap allocations. TinyGo implements simple GC and manages its memory by itself, contrary to specification. So it can't work out of the box on systems where the Host wants to manage the memory [1](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/13761). It might be possible, but the support would be limited and performance might be unsatisfactory.

**Linker globals**
* The Runtime is expected to expose `__heap_base` global [1](https://github.com/tinygo-org/tinygo/issues/2045), but TinyGo doesn't support that out of the box.

**Developer experience**
* Implementing Wasm functionality makes you go pretty low level and use some "unsafe" language constructs.


## Proof of concept (alternative compiler + runtime + GC with external allocator)

TinyGo design decisions are based on optimizations around small embedded devices, which might not always be suitable or required in Wasm.
The project is aimed to support the most recent Wasm spec features.
Also, it will be difficult to support custom and non-standard APIs in the long run, the TinyGo core contributors are a bit against supporting things that are not standardized as is the case with Polkadot Wasm's Runtime specification.
It will be best to implement a solution similar to TinyGo (compiler + runtime + GC with external memory allocator) only targeting Wasm.
The frontend-compiler should be mostly the same as in TinyGo and the runtime might not need to be super size-optimized.

**Add Toolchain support for Substrate's Wasm**
1. [x] Fork TinyGo.
2. [x] Add separate Dockerfile and build script for building TinyGo with prebuild LLVM and deps (for faster builds).
3. Add new target similar to Rust's `wasm32-unknown-unknown`, but aimed to support Substrate/Wasm MVP.
  * [x] add new target `polkawasm.json` in `targets/`
  * [x] add new `polkawasm` implementation in `runtime_polkawasm.go`
  * [x] use the `polkawasm` directive to separate the new target from the existing Wasm/WASI functionality.
  * [x] use linker flag to declare memory as imported.
  * [x] use linker flags to export `__heap_base`, `__data_end` globals.
  * [x] use linker flags to export `__indirect_function_table`.
  * [x] change the stack placement not to start from the beginning of the linear memory.
  * [x] disable the the scheduler to remove the support of goroutines and channels (and JS/WASI exports).
  * [x] remove the unsupported features by Wasm MVP (bulk memory operations, lang. ext) and add implementation of `memmove`, `memset`, `memcpy`, use the opt flag as part of the target.
  * [x] increase the memory size to 20 pages
  * [x] use the conservative GC as a starting point (there is a chance for memory corruption)
  * [x] add GC implementation that can work with external memory allocator (remove memory allocation exports).
  * [x] override the allocation functions used in the GC with such provided by the host.
  * [x] remove the exported allocation functions

  * [ ] the `_start` export func should be called somewhere to init the heap (the host does not support that).
  * [ ] better abstractions, the extalloc GC depends on third party allocation API that might change in the future.

**Setup Host**
1. [x] Fork Gossamer and add it as a submodule.
2. [x] Make some changes to be able to run the Host with localy provided Runtime.
3. [x] Setup test instance to run the compiled Wasm (target MVP, import host provided functions and memory, implement bump allocator).

**Implement Wasm Runtime**
1. [x] Implement SCALE codec without reflection.
2. Implement the minimal Runtime API (core API) and tests for correctness and performance.
  * [x] `Core_version`
  * [ ] `Core_execute_block`
  * [ ] `Core_initialize_block`
3. [x] Add Makefile steps
Read/write from/to the host/Wasm's shared memory.


## Testing Guide

The steps below will showcase testing a PoC Polkadot Runtime implementation in Go.

### Prerequisites
- [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Go 1.18+](https://golang.org/doc/install)
- [docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/)

### Cloning the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LimeChain/gosemble.git

### Build the Runtime

Using a [forked version of TinyGo](https://github.com/radkomih/tinygo/tree/polka-wasm-runtime), we build the Runtime with target `polkawasm`, exported in `build/runtime.wasm`.

```bash
make build
```

### Run Tests

After the runtime has been built, we execute standard Go tests with the help of a [forked version of Gossamer](https://github.com/LimeChain/gossamer), which we use
to import necessary Polkadot Host functionality and interact with the Runtime.

```bash
make test
```

### Optional steps

#### Inspecing the WASM Runtime

[wasmer](https://wasmer.io/)

```bash
wasmer inspect build/runtime.wasm
```

#### Converting WASM from binary to text format

[wasm2wat](https://command-not-found.com/wasm2wat)

```bash
wasm2wat build/runtime.wasm -o build/runtime.wat
cat build/runtime.wat
```

## Future improvements

1. [ ] write performance tests.
2. [ ] complete the SCALE codec implementation.
3. [ ] extalloc GC might need more work.
4. [ ] fix errors outputed in the Wasm memory

  SCALE codec
